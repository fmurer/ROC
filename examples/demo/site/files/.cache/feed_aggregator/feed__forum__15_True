<div class="description">Hi, I just check if the .ecf files are in /usr/share/eiffelstudio-MM.mm/precomp/spec/unix and they are. When I look in the "Locations of configuration files" dialog in EiffelStudio, I see this: # Search paths for precompiled libraries are specified in the configuration file: # /usr/share/ei</div>

<div class="description">Not really. What I need to know is when I run tests on the performance and suitability for use of EiffelBase2, do I have to repeat them with all of ES versions 15.01, 15.08 and 15.11?

<div class="description">In this particular case, it is sufficient to take any version of EiffelStudio and the EiffelBase2 version that comes with it to evaluate EiffelBase2 as the library has not really changed much in the past few years. In the general case, you should stick to one version of EiffelStudio and</div>

<div class="description">As the author of EiffelBase2 does not define any specific versions, I would say - EiffelStudio 14.05 ships EiffelBase2 version 14.05, and associated source code can be found at https://svn.eiffel.com/eiffelstudio/branches/Eiffel_14.05/Src/unstable/library/base2/ (last changed revision: 94979)</div>
